# Architecture Map

This is a functional architecture map of the app — a Hebrew book reader, mobile-first, strictly RTL.

Every folder described here has a `README.md` that goes deeper: which file to edit for a given task, what to import from where, and what constraints apply. When working in any folder, read its README first.

## App Shell

The root layout is `App.vue`, which stacks two elements vertically:

- `AppTitleBar.vue` — fixed 40px header
- `AppPageView.vue` — fills remaining height, renders the active page

`AppPageView` maps `tabStore.activeTab.route` to a page component. Routes `/book-view` and `/search` are keyed by `activeTabId` so they fully remount on tab switch. All other routes share a single instance.

## Setup Wizard

`SetupWizard.vue` is a full-screen onboarding overlay rendered in `App.vue` when `settingsStore.setupDone` is `false`. It covers the entire app until the user completes or skips it.

Steps (in order):

1. `welcome` — always shown; app logo, intro text
2. `db` — only shown when `isHosted && !dbReady`; lets the user download Zayit/Otzaria or pick an existing `.db` file via `window.__webviewPickDbPath`
3. `theme` — theme picker + app zoom slider
4. `general` — divine name censoring, resume-last-read, new-tab destination
5. `book-display` — header/text fonts, font size, line padding; optional separate commentary settings

Navigation: forward/back buttons with a slide transition; a "skip" button calls `settings.completeSetup()` immediately. Progress is shown as a top-edge accent bar.

Completion: `settings.completeSetup()` sets `setupDone = true` and persists it to IDB at key `setupDone` (via `KEYS.SETTINGS_SETUP_DONE` in `persistence.ts`). Once set, the wizard never shows again.

## Title Bar

`AppTitleBar.vue` is the app's only persistent chrome.

- Physical left side: hamburger nav menu (`AppTitleBarNavDropdown`), theme toggle, toolbar toggle (book view only), PDF filter toggle (PDF tabs only)
- Center: active tab title + TOC path (truncated)
- Physical right side: home button, new tab button, close tab button
- Clicking the title bar opens `AppTitleBarTabDropdown` — the full tab list

Keyboard shortcuts handled here: `Ctrl+W` (close tab), `Ctrl+X` (close all), `Ctrl+J` (toggle bottom panel), `Ctrl+F` (guarded — only intercepted when not in a search input).

## Tab System

Tabs are managed entirely by `tabStore`. Each tab is a `Tab` object with a route, title, and optional route-specific state (bookId, PDF info, search query, TOC path, etc.).

Navigation rules:

- `tabStore.updateActiveTab({ route, title, ...data })` — navigate in-place (most common)
- `tabStore.openTab(...)` — explicitly open a new tab (e.g. "new tab" button)
- `tabStore.navigateToSingleton(route)` — for singleton routes; switches to existing tab if one exists, otherwise replaces current tab

Singleton routes (`/settings`, `/books`, `/hebrewbooks`, `/workspaces`) enforce one-tab-per-route and are never persisted across sessions.

Multi-instance routes (`/book-view`, `/search`, `/pdf-view`) can have multiple tabs open simultaneously.

## Feature Folders (`src/features/`)

### home/

Home page navigation tiles. The tile list in `HomePage.vue` and the menu list in `AppTitleBarNavDropdown.vue` are the two entry points to the same set of destinations — they must always be kept in sync. When adding, removing, or renaming a navigation destination, update both files. The home page uses `navigate()` (navigates in the active tab); the nav dropdown uses `navigateInNewTab()` (always opens a new tab). Neither list is derived from the other — they are maintained in parallel.

- `HomePage.vue`, `HomePageTile.vue`, `useHomeDateInfo.ts`, `useDafYomiNavigation.ts`

### book-catalog/

Book catalog browser. Supports list, tiles, and full tree views with search.

- `BookCatalogPage.vue` — main page; owns view switching (list/tiles/tree) via `<component :is>` map

- `booksCategoryTree.ts` — tree building and category metadata

### book-view/

The main book reader. Orchestrates a split pane (text above, commentary below), a TOC side panel, a floating search bar, and a toolbar.

- `BookViewPage.vue` — orchestrator
- `BookViewToolbar.vue` — zoom, search, TOC, bottom panel toggles
- `BookViewSplitPane.vue` — thin wrapper around `SplitPane` that wires the top/bottom slots
- `BookViewLinesContent.vue` — main text (virtual scroller, line selection)
- `BookViewSearchBar.vue` — floating search (query, mode, match navigation)
- `BookViewTocTree.vue` — TOC side panel (main + alt structures)
- `BookViewTocTreeSection.vue` — TOC section header
- `BookViewCommentaryPanel.vue` — thin wrapper passing props into `CommentaryView`
- `CommentaryView.vue` — commentary display grouped by book

- `CommentaryHeaderNav.vue` — prev/next section navigation
- `CommentaryFilterPanel.vue` — dropdown to toggle individual commentary books on/off
- `CommentaryTreeViewNode.vue` — node in the commentary filter tree
- `CommentaryTypeDropdown.vue` — commentary type selector
- `useToc.ts` — loads TOC entries and alt TOC structures for a book; builds a path map (entry id → full breadcrumb string); exposes `getActiveTocEntry` and `getTocPath`
- `useLinesTable.ts` — paginated line fetching from the `line` table in chunks of 200; pre-allocates placeholder slots so the virtualizer has the correct total height immediately, then fills content as chunks arrive; exposes `prioritise(lineIndex)` to move a chunk to the front of the fetch queue
- `useCommentary.ts` — fetches linked commentary for a selected line (or range), groups results by connection type and category, returns `CommentaryGroup[]`
- `useBookViewSearch.ts` — content search (line-based)
- `useCommentarySearch.ts` — commentary search (flat index-based)
- `useBookView.ts` — central composable; owns all data loading, state, event handlers, and watchers. `BookViewPage.vue` is a shell that calls this.
- `useBookViewScrollSync.ts` — syncs active TOC entry and auto-selects commentary on scroll
- `useBookViewSessionRestore.ts` — restores per-book view state from IDB on mount
- `useCommentaryNavigation.ts` — next/prev section navigation for the commentary panel
- `usePinnedCommentary.ts` — tracks the pinned commentary book with default-commentator fallback
- `useTocScrollTracking.ts` — tracks programmatic TOC scrolls to suppress active-entry updates during animation
- `bookViewTypes.ts` — shared types: `SearchMode`, `SidePanelMode`

### full-text-search/

Full-text search backed by FtsLib (LSM-style segment index with delta+varint compressed posting lists). Supports category/book filters and caches results in IDB.

- `FullTextSearchPage.vue` — main page
- `FullTextSearchBar.vue` — search input + filter toggle
- `FullTextSearchResultsList.vue` — results (virtual scroller)
- `FullTextSearchFilterPanel.vue` — category/book filter tree
- `FullTextSearchFilterNode.vue` — filter tree node
- `FullTextSearchIndexingOverlay.vue` — indexing progress overlay; shown while the index is building; search is enabled as soon as the first segment is flushed (partial index)
- `useFullTextSearch.ts` — search execution and IDB caching; streams results from C# in batches via `chrome.webview` message events; enriches each batch with TOC paths via a SQL query; resumes interrupted searches from the cache skip offset
- `useFullTextSearchIndexingStatus.ts` — subscribes to `ftsIndexProgress` push events from C#; handles `ftsIndexVersionMismatch` (prompts user to rebuild) and `ftsIndexInvalidated` (automatic rebuild)
- `useFullTextSearchFilters.ts` — filter state (checked books/categories), result filtering, and result click handler
- `fullTextSearchTypes.ts` — TypeScript types

#### Query syntax (passed verbatim to FtsLib)

- Multiple words are AND-ed. `word*` is a wildcard (prefix, infix, or suffix). `word~` / `word~2` / `word~3` is fuzzy (edit distance 1–3). `a | b` is OR within one AND slot.
- The frontend passes two additional parameters: `maxWordDistance` (default 10 — maximum token distance between matched terms in a line) and `requireOrdered` (default false — whether terms must appear in query order). These are applied inside FtsLib's snippet pipeline, not during index intersection.

### settings/

App settings across three tabs: general, reading, and advanced. Also contains the setup wizard.

- `SettingsPage.vue` — three-tab page shell
- `SettingsGeneralPane.vue` — general tab: theme, zoom, toolbar position, reading behavior, divine name censoring
- `SettingsReadingPane.vue` — reading tab: book and commentary font/size/padding settings
- `SettingsAdvancedPane.vue` — advanced tab: database path picker (hosted only), reset settings, full app reset
- `SettingRow.vue`, `HintIcon.vue`, `SliderSetting.vue`, `ToggleGroup.vue`
- `ThemePicker.vue`, `FontDisplaySettings.vue`, `FontSelector.vue`
- `useSettingsPage.ts`

### hebrew-books/

HebrewBooks catalog browser with download history.

- `HebrewBooksPage.vue`, `HebrewBooksListItem.vue`
- `useHebrewBooks.ts`, `hebrewBooksCatalog.ts`

### halachic-units/

Halachic unit converter. Singleton route `/midot`. Converts between biblical, Talmudic, and modern units across six systems (length, area, volume, weight, coins, time) with support for multiple halachic opinions.

- `HalachicUnitsPage.vue` — full converter UI with opinion selector and conversion explanation
- `halachicUnits.ts` — all conversion logic (`convert`, `toMetric`, `explainConversion`)
- `units/` — unit definitions per measurement system; `types.ts` for shared types

### pdf-viewer/

PDF viewer. Embeds a PDF.js iframe.

- `PdfViewPage.vue`

### kiwix/

Kiwix ZIM file reader. Embeds Kiwix JS in an iframe to render offline ZIM archives (Wikipedia, reference works, etc.). FTS is disabled by default to avoid loading the Xapian WASM index; a future per-tab setting can enable it.

- `KiwixViewPage.vue` — iframe wrapper loading `/kiwix/www/index.html` with the ZIM virtual host URL

### workspace/

Workspace CRUD UI.

- `WorkspaceManagerPage.vue`

### hebrew-calendar/

Hebrew calendar page. Monthly grid and weekly detail views with zmanim. Singleton route.

- `HebrewCalendarPage.vue` — orchestrator, view-mode toggle, city picker
- `MonthlyView.vue` — monthly grid with Hebrew dates, holidays, parasha
- `WeeklyView.vue` — week view with events, candle lighting, zmanim, daily learning
- `DayRow.vue`, `CalendarHeader.vue`, `calendarTypes.ts`
- `useMonthlyView.ts` — month navigation, keeps Gregorian and Hebrew month in sync
- `useWeeklyView.ts` — week data via `@hebcal/core`, daily learning via `hebrewLearning.ts`
- `useZmanim.ts` — city selection, geolocation, zmanim calculation

## App Shell (`src/layout/`)

- `AppTitleBar.vue`, `AppPageView.vue`, `AppTitleBarTabDropdown.vue`, `AppTitleBarNavDropdown.vue`

`AppTitleBarNavDropdown` is the hamburger nav menu. Its destination list mirrors the tiles in `HomePage.vue` — see the `home/` section for the sync rule.

## Shared Components (`src/components/`)

Reusable UI primitives used across multiple features. No feature-specific logic lives here.

- `TreeView.vue`, `TreeNode.vue` — generic tree
- `treeTypes.ts` — `TreeNodeItem` interface; import from here, never from `TreeNode.vue`
- `SplitPane.vue` — resizable split pane
- `BottomSearchBar.vue`, `ContextMenu.vue`, `ConfirmDialog.vue`, `LoadingAnimation.vue`
- `HintIcon.vue` — tooltip hint icon
- `IconTreeRtl.vue` — `IconTextBulletListTree` pre-flipped for RTL layout

## App Shell (`src/layout/`)

## Pinia Stores (`src/stores/`)

**tabStore** — tab lifecycle, navigation, and all per-tab/per-book state persistence. The central store — most features read from it.

**bookViewStore** — book viewer UI state: toolbar visibility, floating search bar position, per-tab+book zoom map. Exposes a reactive `zoom` computed for the active tab+book.

**settingsStore** — all app-wide settings (fonts, sizes, padding, zoom, diacritics, censoring, etc.). Each setting has its own IDB key and is watched individually.

**booksDataStore** — lazy-loaded book catalog. Fetches all categories and books on first access, builds the category tree, assigns period metadata.

**workspaceStore** — workspace management. All tab/book IDB keys are workspace-scoped; switching workspaces changes `activeId` and reloads tabs.

**pdfStore** — PDF and Word file handling. Manages conversion state, HebrewBooks download state, and session restore for PDF tabs. Listens to C# push events (`conversionStarted`, `hbPdfReady`, `hbPdfCancelled`).

**zimStore** — Kiwix ZIM file handling. Manages virtual host URL and session restore for `/kiwix-view` tabs. Listens to the `zimReady` C# push event. No conversion pipeline — ZIM files are always local and served directly.

**searchCacheStore** — LRU cache for FTS search results (capped at 100 entries), stored in `app-search-cache` IDB.

**hebrewBooksHistoryStore** — HebrewBooks download history, stored in `app-hb-history` IDB, LRU-capped at 25 entries.

## Composables (`src/composables/`)

**useAppNavigation.ts** — central navigation handler. Routes singletons via `navigateToSingleton()`, handles file picker, external links, and search navigation.

**useVirtualScrollerKeys.ts** — keyboard nav for virtual scrollers (`Ctrl+Home`, `Ctrl+End`). Required on every component that uses `@tanstack/vue-virtual`. The scroll container must have `tabindex="0"`.

**useZoom.ts** — zoom handler for keyboard (`Ctrl+±/0`), wheel (`Ctrl+scroll`), and pinch (2-finger touch). Config: MIN=50, MAX=200, DEFAULT=100, STEP=10.

**useListKeyNav.ts** — arrow-key + Home/End navigation for plain DOM lists; tracks `focusedIndex` and scrolls the focused item into view.

**useTextSelectionKeys.ts** — `Ctrl+A` (select all text in a container) and `Ctrl+F` (open search) scoped to a specific element.

**useTileGridKeys.ts** — 2D arrow-key navigation for tile grids; computes column count from container width to handle Up/Down correctly.

**useVirtualListKeyNav.ts** — arrow-key + `Ctrl+Home`/`Ctrl+End` navigation for `@tanstack/vue-virtual` lists; calls `scrollToIndex` on the virtualizer.

**useLineCopy.ts** — intercepts the browser `copy` event on a scroller element; when the user has selected all, writes each line as a `<div>` in `text/html` and strips HTML tags for `text/plain`, so copied text has no inline line breaks.

**useDropdownClose.ts** — drop-in replacement for `onClickOutside` that also closes on window blur and handles the toggle-button race condition. Use on every dropdown instead of `onClickOutside` directly.

### db.ts

The database access layer. Exports:

- `isHosted` — true when running inside C# WebView2 host (or in dev mode)
- `dbReady` — reactive ref, true once a DB path is available
- `query<T>(sql, params)` — executes SQL via `window.__webviewQuery` (C# host) or a `/query` POST to the Vite dev middleware
- `onWebviewEvent(fn)` — subscribe to C# push events

### bridge.ts

C# host actions for file operations. All functions have dev fallbacks.

- `pickFile()` — native file picker (PDF + Word)
- `restoreLocalPdf(filePath)` — re-register virtual host for a local file
- `restoreHbPdf(bookId, bookTitle, tabId)` — restore HebrewBooks PDF from cache
- `disposePdfHost(filePath)` — decrement virtual host ref count on tab close
- `callBridgeAction(name, ...params)` — call any C# action with positional params (used by search/indexing)
- `resetHostApp()` — full app reset: deletes FTS index, resets C# settings, reloads
- `resetSearchIndex()` — resets the FTS index on the C# side (triggers a fresh rebuild)

### queries.sql.ts

All raw SQL strings for the frontend live here. No inline SQL anywhere else in the Vue/TypeScript codebase — every query a composable or store needs must be added to this file and imported from it.

The one exception is `ZayitDb.cs` in FtsLib (`CSharpBackend/FtsLib/FtsLib/Misc/ZayitDb.cs`), which owns the SQL used exclusively by the FTS indexing and search pipeline. That SQL never crosses into the frontend and is not duplicated in `queries.sql.ts`. No other C# file may contain inline SQL — `DbHandler.cs` is a passthrough that executes whatever SQL the frontend sends; it has no queries of its own.

## Utilities (`src/utils/`)

**persistence.ts** — the only file that touches IndexedDB and localStorage directly. All stores import from here; components and composables never do. Manages 3 IDB databases, all key patterns, LRU cap for lastread, the app reset mechanism, and the `__pendingReset` localStorage flag.

**commentaryNav.ts** — commentary section navigation (next/prev section, TOC-aware).

**hebrewTextProcessing.ts** — diacritics handling and text normalization for Hebrew.

**censorDivineNames.ts** — divine name censoring (replaces ה with ק).

**normalizeText.ts** — `normalize(s)`: lowercases and strips Hebrew/ASCII quote characters. Import this as the base normalization step before any search comparison.

**tocSearchUtils.ts** — TOC search path building (`buildTocSearchPaths`), query splitting (`splitQuery`), and ordered subsequence word matching (`matchWords`). Re-exports `SegmentSearchTree` as `SearchableTree` for backward compatibility — new code should import `SegmentSearchTree` from `segmentSearchTree.ts` directly.

**segmentSearchTree.ts** — generic segment-aware search tree for any hierarchical node list. `SegmentSearchTree` matches query words as an ordered subsequence across ancestor path segments. Used by `TreeView.vue`, `CommentaryFilterPanel.vue`, `bookCatalogSearchTocHeuristics.ts`, and `dafYomiNavigation.ts`.

**detectFonts.ts** — `detectAvailableFonts()` uses canvas measurement to detect which Hebrew and general fonts are installed. Used by `FontSelector.vue`.

**scrollToIndexWithRetry.ts** — virtual scroller scroll-to-index with retry for async rendering.

**resetState.ts** — exports a single `resetting` ref that is set to `true` just before an app reset/reload, blocking all interaction until the page reloads.

**hebrewLearning.ts** — `getDailyLearning(hd)` returns today's schedule for all daily learning cycles (Daf Yomi, Mishna Yomi, Nach Yomi, Rambam, etc.). Used by the home page and the calendar weekly view.

**booksCategoryTree.ts** — pure data logic for the book catalog tree. Exports `buildTree`, `assignFullPaths`, `findCategoryMeta`, `ensureBookSearchMetadata`, and the `BookRow`, `CategoryRow`, `CategoryNode` types. No Vue or Pinia dependencies.

## Theme System (`src/theme/`)

- `theme.css` — CSS custom properties (colors, fonts, spacing) for all themes
- `themeStore.ts` — active theme preset + reading background color
- `themes.ts` — theme loading, custom theme support, PDF theme observer
- `themeTypes.ts` — TypeScript types
- `themeColorUtils.ts` — color manipulation utilities
- `ThemeToggle.vue` — toggle button in the title bar
- `themes.json` — built-in theme presets

Default theme is `vscode-dark`. Custom themes are stored in `app-settings` IDB at key `customThemes`.

## Initialization Order (`main.ts`)

1. `idbCheckAndExecReset()` — clear all DBs if a reset was scheduled last session
2. Create Pinia
3. `workspaceStore.init()` — must be first; `tabStore` depends on `activeId`
4. In parallel: `tabStore.init()`, `bookViewStore.init()`, `settingsStore.init()`, `themeStore.init()`, `loadCustomThemes()`
5. Restore persisted PDF tabs via `pdfStore.restoreTab()`
6. Mount app to `#app`
7. `initPdfThemeObserver()` — sync PDF iframe theme with app theme
8. `booksDataStore.ensureLoaded()` — lazy-load book catalog in background

## C# Backend

The C# project (`CSharpBackend/`) hosts the Vue app in a WebView2 control.

- Vue builds as a single-file bundle (`vite-plugin-singlefile`) — all JS/CSS inlined into one `index.html`
- `KitveiHakodesh.targets` runs `npm run build` after every C# build and copies `dist/` to `bin/{Config}/KitveiHakodesh/`
- C# injects `window.__webviewQuery`, `window.__webviewAction`, `window.__webviewDbReady` before the app boots
- Push events from C# arrive via `window.__onWebviewEvent`
- Target: .NET 4.8, C# 7.3

Key C# handlers:

- `JsBridge.cs` — handles `__webviewAction` calls (file picker, PDF restore, virtual host management)
- `WebBridge.cs` — WebView2 setup, message routing
- `DbAccess.cs` / `DbHandler.cs` — SQLite access via Dapper
- `SearchHandler.cs` — FTS index lifecycle orchestrator (actor-thread pattern); delegates to `FtsIndexBuilder`, `FtsIndexState`, and `FtsSearchExecutor` in `KitveiHakodeshLib/Search/`
- `HebrewBooksHandler.cs` — HebrewBooks download via WebView2 browser engine
- `PdfHandler.cs` — PDF virtual host management
- `ZimHandler.cs` — ZIM virtual host management (Kiwix reader)
- `WordToPdfConverter.cs` — Word-to-PDF conversion

### FTS Search Pipeline

The full-text search pipeline spans three layers: FtsLib (the index engine), KitveiHakodeshLib (the C# orchestration layer), and the Vue frontend.

**FtsLib** (`CSharpBackend/FtsLib/`) is a standalone library with its own git repo. It exposes a single public entry point: `SeforimIndex` in `FtsLib/Seforim/`. The `Core/` folder contains the index engine internals — `IndexWriter`, `IndexReader`, `SegmentMerger`, `QueryParser`, `SearchExecutor`, `SnippetBuilder`, `Tokenizer`, `FuzzyExpander`, `WildcardExpander`, and the posting-list iterators. The `Misc/` folder contains `ZayitDb.cs`, which owns all SQL for reading lines from the seforim database during indexing and search result hydration. `SeforimIndex` is the only class the rest of the app ever touches.

**KitveiHakodeshLib/Search/** contains four classes that orchestrate the lifecycle:

- `FtsIndexState` — owns all mutable state (current state machine position, `SeforimIndex` instance, DB path, running tasks). All field mutations go through its named transition methods. State machine: Idle → Building → Ready → Merging → Ready.
- `FtsIndexBuilder` — starts and runs the build (`Task.Run`) and background merge. Pushes `ftsIndexProgress` events to the frontend every 5000 lines. Marks the index partially ready as soon as the first segment is flushed so search is available before the build completes.
- `FtsSearchExecutor` — runs each search on a `Task.Run` thread, streams results back to the frontend in batches via `WebBridge.PushEvent` (which calls `PostWebMessageAsString` → `chrome.webview` message events). Batch size starts at 1 and doubles up to 16, then switches to a 150ms timer flush. Applies `maxWordDistance` and `requireOrdered` filters inside the snippet loop.
- `SearchHandler` — thin orchestrator. Serializes all lifecycle operations (OnDbReady, ResetAndReindex, HandleDeleteIndex) through a `BlockingCollection<Action>` actor thread so they never race. Delegates search start/cancel to `FtsSearchExecutor`.

**Vue frontend** (`src/features/full-text-search/`):

- `useFullTextSearch.ts` — calls `FtsSearchStart` via `callBridgeAction`, receives batches via a `chrome.webview` message listener keyed by `searchId`, enriches each batch with TOC paths via `GET_TOC_PATHS_FOR_LINES`, appends to the IDB cache via `searchCacheStore`. On a cache hit with a complete result set, skips the stream entirely. On a partial cache hit, passes `skipCount` to C# so the stream resumes from where it left off.
- `useFullTextSearchIndexingStatus.ts` — subscribes to `ftsIndexProgress` push events via `onWebviewEvent`. Handles `ftsIndexVersionMismatch` (prompts user to confirm rebuild) and `ftsIndexInvalidated` (automatic rebuild, no prompt).

**Bridge actions** (all handled by `SearchHandler` via `JsBridge.cs`):

| Action | Direction | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FtsSearchStart` | Vue → C# | Start a search; returns `{ searchId }` |
| `FtsSearchCancel` | Vue → C# | Cancel an in-flight search by `searchId` |
| `GetFtsIndexingProgress` | Vue → C# | Poll current indexing state on mount |
| `FtsConfirmReindex` | Vue → C# | User's response to the version-mismatch prompt |
| `ResetFtsIndex` | Vue → C# | Delete index and rebuild from scratch |
| `searchBatch` | C# → Vue | Batch of `FullTextSearchResult` objects |
| `searchComplete` | C# → Vue | Stream finished |
| `searchCancelled` | C# → Vue | Stream cancelled |
| `searchError` | C# → Vue | Stream error |
| `ftsIndexProgress` | C# → Vue | Indexing progress tick |
| `ftsIndexVersionMismatch` | C# → Vue | App version changed; user must confirm rebuild |
| `ftsIndexInvalidated` | C# → Vue | Index corrupt or missing; rebuild started automatically |
